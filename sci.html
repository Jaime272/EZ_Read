                                would not have entered the new millennium if it hadn’t been for them. They designed a
                                 symbol in 1969 when they were young. That sign reappears
                                 in 1997 when the impending calamity begins to take shape. This is the narrative 
                                 of a gang of young lads who attempt to save the planet.  </p>

                                 “AVERAGE,” from his lifeless look to his bald head to his mediocre body. However, 
                                 this ordinary-looking man does not have an ordinary condition.  He’s a superhero 
                                on the hunt for difficult opponents! The problem is that whenever he finds a potential
                                 candidate, he knocks the crap out of them with one punch.</p>

                                for the moon one night when they were young in 2006. That night, they resolved to become
                                 astronauts and fly to space. Hibito has become an astronaut and plans to visit the moon 
                                 in 2025. Mutta eventually landed a more typical job with an auto development firm. On the
